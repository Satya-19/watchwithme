# WatchWithMe!
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ssd71/watchwithme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ssd71/watchwithme)
WatchWithMe is a web application I made out of necessity, while sitting out in the heat of summer in the middle of nowhere, trying to watch anime with a certain _someone_. The instructions are on the webpage itself. I will update this with a link to the website after I actually deploy it. To run locally:

- Clone the repository locally
- `npm index.js`

In it's current state, it can only sync up two users playing a local(browser compatible) video file. The files need not be the same, which although does give rise to some ambiguity, I decided not to enforce these limitations since I was going to be actually using slightly different files in my usecase.
